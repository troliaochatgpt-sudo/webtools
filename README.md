# Personal Homepage – Launch Studio Project

This is my personal homepage project created for the Launch Studio training site. The page introduces who I am, my developer identity, and my learning journey.

## Files Included
- `index.html`: Main HTML file structured using semantic HTML5
- `images/avatar.jpg`: My personal photo (used in the homepage)
- `README.md`: This file

## Page Sections
The homepage includes the following three narrative sections:

- **About Me**: My background, interests, and early exposure to computers
- **Developer Identity**: My mindset and goals as a new web developer
- **Learning Journey**: Why I joined this course and how I’m building my skills

The site uses semantic tags such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, and inline tags like `<em>` and `<strong>`. One image is used with proper `alt` text and caption for accessibility.

## AI or Tool Usage
Some content in this project was supported by ChatGPT to help brainstorm ideas, improve clarity, and structure my writing. All final edits were written and reviewed by me.

> `<meta name="description" content="This page includes content assisted by AI tools.">` has been included in the `<head>` section of the HTML file.
