            <p>Hello! I'm Duy Nguyen, and I'm currently a student at Dallas College. I'm pursuing an AAS degree in Computer Information Technology with a focus on web development. Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with my dog and exploring new technologies. Also I often listen to music and exercise with my dad every afternoon.</p>
            <p>My interest in technology began when I was just a kid. Back then, my family owned an internet cafe, which gave me early access to computers. Being surrounded by technology at such a young age sparked my curiosity and passion for learning about computers and the internet. Through curiosity and exploration, I discovered my love for coding and web development.</p>

            <p>To be honest, I'm still new to web development, and I'm learning everything step by step. I don't have a strong background in coding yet, but I'm trying my best. I enjoy the process of figuring things out-like how tags work, what each part of a webpage does, and how everything connects together. It feels good when something finally clicks after struggling with it for a while.</p>
            <p>I see myself as a quiet learner. I don't always speak up in class or know all the answers, but I care about doing things properly. <strong>Even if it's just a small assignment, I want my code to be clean and easy to understand.</strong> I believe that building a strong foundation now will help me later when I work n bigger projects.</p>

        <section id="journey" aria-labelledby="journey-heading">
            <h2 id="journey-heading">Learning Journey</h2>
            <p>I decide to take this course because I want to understand how websites really work from the ground up. I've seen so many websites in my life, but I never knew what was behind them. Now that I'm learning HTML, I realize there's a lot of structure and logic that makes everything come together. It's honestly kind of fun to build a page from scratch and see it come to life.</p>
            <p>At first, learning HTML felt a bit strange because everything was new to me. I wasn't used to writing code with angle brackets and special tags. But the more I practiced, the more it started to make sense. <strong>I don't know everything yet, but I know I'm improving with each step I take.</strong></p>
            <p>My goal is to keep practicing, keep building small projects, and push myself to finish what I start. I hope that by the end of this class, I'll be able to look back at my homepage and feel proud of how far I've come. I know I still have a lot to learn, but I'm excited to keep going!</p>
